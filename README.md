# Moonwalk

## Running this project
A version compiled for linux x86 and x86_64 are included in the repo so
building is not nesissary for evaluation.

## Installing rust for building (rutgers ILab)
1. run `./installrust.sh` which will install rustc and cargo to your ~/local
2. run `source activate.sh` which will add bins and dynamic libraries needed for rust
to your path
3. cargo build
